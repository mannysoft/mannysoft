### About me ðŸ‘‹

I'm an enthusiastic web and mobile developer with over a decade of experience in the industry. My primary focus is on PHP and Laravel, but I'm also skilled in developing mobile applications using the Flutter framework.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a cloud-based HR management system, specifically focusing on time attendance and payroll. :)
- ðŸŒ± I'm presently picking up Golang. I might employ it down the line if PHP/Laravel can't manage the workload, though I'm skeptical that'll occur within the next five years.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm interested in partnering on an HR system across various regions and countries. I would be delighted to discuss the system you currently have in place.
- ðŸ¤” I'm seeking assistance with translations in the near future.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to inquire about anything related to PHP and Laravel. I'm definitely here to assist you.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at manny.isles at gmail dot com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to travel with my laptop on me. Got a nice beach near you? Lets go!
