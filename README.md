### About me ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate web and mobile developer. Been in the industry for more than a decade.
I work mostly using PHP and Laravel but I can also do mobile application using Flutter framework.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on cloud base HR management system. Time attendance and payroll system to be exact :) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning golang. I might use it in the future when PHP/Laravel cant handle the load but I doubt it will happen in the next 5 years.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some HR system in different regions and countries. Im more than happy to talk about the system you have.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with translations soon.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about PHP and Laravel things. I can help you for sure.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at manny.isles at gmail dot com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to travel with my laptop on me. Got a nice beach near you? Lets go!
